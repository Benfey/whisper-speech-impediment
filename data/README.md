# Data Directory Structure

This directory should contain your voice recordings and their transcriptions organized as follows:

## Directory Structure

```
data/
├── raw/                # Place your original WAV recordings here
│   ├── recording1.wav
│   ├── recording1.txt  # Transcription for recording1.wav
│   ├── recording2.wav
│   ├── recording2.txt  # Transcription for recording2.wav
│   └── ...
├── processed/          # Processed audio files (16kHz mono WAV)
├── text               # Generated by prepare_data.py
└── audio_paths        # Generated by prepare_data.py
```

## File Format Requirements

1. Audio Files:

   - Format: WAV
   - Duration: < 30 seconds per file
   - Naming: Any name with .wav extension
   - Place in: data/raw/

2. Transcription Files:
   - Format: Plain text (.txt)
   - Naming: Same as audio file but with .txt extension
   - Content: Word-for-word transcription
   - Place in: data/raw/
   - Example: If audio is "recording1.wav", transcription should be "recording1.txt"

## Example

For an audio file `data/raw/recording1.wav` containing the speech "Hello world", create:

`data/raw/recording1.txt`:

```
Hello world
```

The prepare_data.py script will process these files and create the required text and audio_paths files automatically.
